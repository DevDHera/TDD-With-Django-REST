# TDD-With-Django-REST ðŸ˜Ž

This project is a guide to REST API development with the help of [Django Rest Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/).

A [Test Driven Development ](https://hackernoon.com/introduction-to-test-driven-development-tdd-61a13bc92d92) approach is used to build out this project and API contains features such as,

- Fully fledged Authentication mechanisam
- Image Upload
- CRUD and relations

and much more.

## Getting Started

Getting started with the `TDD-With-Django-REST` is easy.

1. First clone the project.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DevDHera/TDD-With-Django-REST.git
```

2. Start your docker machine.

3. Go to the root of your cloned project and build the docker image.

```sh
docker-compose build
```

4. Do the neccessary migrations.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations"
```

5. Run the app using `docker-compose`.

```sh
docker-compose up
```

5. Now head over to our [issue board](https://github.com/DevDHera/TDD-With-Django-REST/issues) and help solving issues ðŸ‘¼.

### Prerequisites

`TDD-With-Django-REST` uses **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** to manage containers.

In order to successfully run the project install the following.

- Docker

### Configurations

After installing the above you can provision services as you like using the `docker-compose.yml` file on the root of the project.

Following is the structure that we are using.

```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  app:
    restart: always
    build:
      context: .
    ports:
      - '8000:8000'
    volumes:
      - ./app:/app
    command: >
      sh -c "python manage.py wait_for_db &&
         python manage.py migrate &&
         python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_NAME=app
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASS=supersecretpassword
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:12-alpine
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=app
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecretpassword
```

## Running the tests

As the project uses a TDD approach test take a key role. Following describes how you can run the tests and lints.

### Break down into tests

Each app contains test folder that will is used to test each part of the API. You can run these tests by using the below script.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py test"
```

### And coding style tests

[Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used to enforce the coding styles. Lint command as belows.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "flake8"
```

You can run both the tests and lints in one go like below.

```sh
docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py test && flake8"
```

## Deployment

To deploy the API first you can use the power of `docker-compose`.

Simply run the belwo.

```sh
docker-compose up
```
